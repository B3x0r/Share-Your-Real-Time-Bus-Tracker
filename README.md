# Share-Your-Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
#### Description:
This was a week 9 assignment that originally just pulled up real time data for the route 1 bus in the console. I added a satellite street map of Boston. Then, I added markers for all of the buses running at a given time and have them moving around the map with updated locations every 15 seconds.
 
#### Installation:
 
You can copy the files into the same folder on your device. You will need to add your mapboxgl access token to line 2 of the .js file. Then, you drag the .html file and it into the url line. Then, you can watch the buses move by. You can even zoom in and out to see more of the city.
 
#### Usage:
 
It can help you plan a bus trip from MIT to Harvard, or anywhere in Boston.
 
#### Support: 
 
It doesn't really do enough to need support yet.
 
#### Roadmap: 
 My plan was to make each marker labeled with a number, but I couldnâ€™t get that to show up.
